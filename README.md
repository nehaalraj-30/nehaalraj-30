# 👋 Hi, I'm Nehaal
  
🔧 I'm passionate about **digital system design**, **FPGA implementation**, and **hardware-software co-design**.  
📚 I'm actively exploring **analog circuits**, **VLSI design**, and low-level embedded systems to broaden my skill set.

---

## 💡 What I'm Into
- ✅ RTL design using Verilog/SystemVerilog
- ✅ FPGA-based prototyping and logic design
- ✅ Signal processing and system modeling
- ✅ Schematic and PCB design (beginner-level)
- ✅ Building brain-stimulating, logic-heavy project

---

## 🚀 Current Goals
- Deepen expertise in **FPGA design flow** using tools like Vivado and Quartus  
- Learn backend VLSI and physical design concepts  
- Contribute to open-source projects related to **EDA tools** or **hardware modeling**  
- Build personal projects that bring together analog, digital, and software domains
